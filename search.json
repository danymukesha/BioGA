Genomic data can provide valuable insights various biological processes, gene expression, genetic variation, evolutionary relationships. ’s example genomic data: example, row represents gene (genomic feature), column represents sample. values matrix represent measurement gene expression, mRNA levels protein abundance, sample. instance, value 0.1 Sample 1 Gene1 indicates expression level Gene1 Sample 1. Similarly, value 2.2 Sample 2 Gene3 indicates expression level Gene3 Sample 2. Genomic data can used various analyses, including genetic association studies, gene expression analysis, comparative genomics. context evaluate_fitness_cpp function, genomic data used calculate fitness scores individuals population, typically context genetic algorithm optimization. population represents set candidate combinations genes predictive trait. individual population represented binary vector indicating presence absence gene. example, individual population might represented [1, 0, 1], indicating presence Gene1 Gene3 absence Gene2. population undergoes genetic algorithm operations selection, crossover, mutation, replacement evolve towards individuals higher predictive power trait. fitness calculation described provided code calculates measure dissimilarity gene expression profiles individuals population genomic data. measure dissimilarity, “fitness”, quantifies well gene expression profile individual matches genomic data. Mathematically, fitness calculation can represented follows: Let: \\(g_{ijk}\\) gene expression level gene \\(j\\) individual \\(\\) sample \\(k\\) genomic data. \\(p_{ij}\\) gene expression level gene \\(j\\) individual \\(\\) population. \\(N\\) number individuals population. \\(G\\) number genes. \\(S\\) number samples. , fitness \\(F_i\\) individual \\(\\) population can calculated sum squared differences gene expression levels individual \\(\\) corresponding gene expression levels genomic data, across genes samples: \\[ F_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{G} \\sum_{k=1}^{S} (g_{ijk} - p_{ij})^2 \\] fitness calculation aims minimize overall dissimilarity gene expression profiles individuals population genomic data. Individuals lower fitness scores considered gene expression profiles similar genomic data therefore likely selected optimization genetic algorithm.","code":"# Load the BioGA package library(BioGA)  # Define parameters for genetic algorithm population_size <- 100 generations <- 50 mutation_rate <- 0.1  # Generate example genomic data genomic_data <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10, ncol = 10) Sample 1   Sample 2   Sample 3   Sample 4 Gene1    0.1        0.2        0.3        0.4 Gene2    1.2        1.3        1.4        1.5 Gene3    2.3        2.2        2.1        2.0 # Initialize population population <- initialize_population_cpp(genomic_data, population_size = 5) # Initialize fitness history fitness_history <- list()  # Initialize time progress start_time <- Sys.time()  # Run genetic algorithm optimization generation <- 0 while (TRUE) {     generation <- generation + 1          # Evaluate fitness     fitness <- evaluate_fitness_cpp(genomic_data, population)     fitness_history[[generation]] <- fitness          # Check termination condition     if (generation==6) {         break     }          # Selection     selected_parents <- selection_cpp(population, fitness, num_parents = 2)      # Crossover and Mutation     offspring <- crossover_cpp(selected_parents, offspring_size = 2)     mutated_offspring <- mutation_cpp(offspring, mutation_rate = 0) # (no mutation in this example)      # Replacement     population <- replacement_cpp(population, mutated_offspring, num_to_replace = 1)          # Calculate time progress     elapsed_time <- difftime(Sys.time(), start_time, units = \"secs\")          # Print time progress     cat(\"\\rGeneration:\", generation, \"- Elapsed Time:\", format(elapsed_time, units = \"secs\"), \"     \") } #>  Generation: 1 -
