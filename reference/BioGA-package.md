# BioGA: Bioinformatics Genetic Algorithm (BioGA)

Genetic algorithm are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by the
process of natural selection and genetics. This package allows users to
analyze and optimize high throughput genomic data using genetic
algorithms. The functions provided are implemented in C++ for improved
speed and efficiency, with an easy-to-use interface for use within R.
