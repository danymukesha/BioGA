Description: Genetic algorithm are a class of optimization algorithms
    inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. This
    package allows users to analyze and optimize high throughput genomic
    data using genetic algorithms.  The functions provided are implemented
    in C++ for improved speed and efficiency, with an easy-to-use
    interface for use within R.
