# Introduction

This report provides a detailed mathematical analysis of the BioGA R
package, which implements a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) for
genomic data optimization. The analysis covers all major components of
the algorithm with formal mathematical notation and proofs where
applicable.

# Genetic Algorithm Framework

The package implements a standard generational GA with the following
components:

1.  Population Initialization
2.  Fitness Evaluation
3.  Selection (NSGA-II inspired)
4.  Crossover (SBX)
5.  Mutation (Adaptive)
6.  Replacement (Elitism + Diversity Preservation)

## Mathematical Representation

Let:

-   $G = (V, E)$ be the gene network where
    $V = \{g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n\}$ are genes
-   $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ be the genomic data matrix ($n$
    genes × $m$ samples)
-   $P_t \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}$ be the population at generation
    $t$ ($p$ individuals × $n$ genes)

The GA can be represented as:

$$
P_{t+1} = R(M(C(S(P_t, f(P_t)), X)), P_t, f(P_t))
$$

Where:

-   $f$: Fitness evaluation function

-   $S$: Selection operator

-   $C$: Crossover operator

-   $M$: Mutation operator

-   $R$: Replacement operator

# Population Initialization

## Mathematical Formulation

Given genomic data $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ and population size
$p$:

$$
P_0[i,j] = X[j, k] \quad \text{where} \quad k \sim \text{Uniform}\{1, \ldots, m\}
$$

**With clustering** (if provided): For each cluster $c \in C$:

$$
P_0[i,j] = X[j, k] \quad \forall j \in c, \quad k \sim \text{Uniform}\{1, \ldots, m\}
$$

## Properties

1.  Maintains original data distribution per gene
2.  Preserves cluster structure if provided
3.  Expected value: $\mathbb{E}[P_0[i,j]] = \mu_j$ (mean of gene $j$)

# Fitness Evaluation

The package implements a multi-objective fitness function with two
components:

## Objective 1: Expression Difference

$$
f_1(i) = \sum_j \sum_k (X_{jk} - P_{ij})^2
$$

This measures how well the individual matches the observed expression
patterns.

**Properties**:

1.  Convex function with minimum at $P_{ij} = \mu_j$

2.  Gradient: $\nabla f_1 = -2\sum_k(X_{jk} - P_{ij})$

## Objective 2: Sparsity

$$
f_2(i) = \frac{\sum_j I(|P_{ij}| > \epsilon)}{n}
$$

Where $I$ is the indicator function and $\epsilon$ is a small constant
($10^{-6}$).

**Properties**:

1.  Non-convex, non-differentiable

2.  Encourages sparse solutions

3.  Range: $[0, 1]$

## Combined Fitness

$$
F(i) = w_1f_1(i) + w_2f_2(i)
$$

Where $w$ are user-provided weights.

# Selection (NSGA-II Inspired)

The selection implements a simplified version of NSGA-II's non-dominated
sorting:

## Domination Criteria

Individual $i$ dominates $j$ iff:

$$
\forall k: f_k(i) \leq f_k(j) \quad \text{and} \quad \exists k: f_k(i) < f_k(j)
$$

**Proof of Partial Order**:

1.  Reflexive: No individual dominates itself

2.  Antisymmetric: If $i$ dominates $j$, $j$ cannot dominate $i$

3.  Transitive: If $i$ dominates $j$ and $j$ dominates $k$, then $i$
    dominates $k$

## Front Construction

1.  Compute domination counts and dominated sets
2.  First front: Individuals with domination count $= 0$
3.  Subsequent fronts: Remove current front, update counts

**Theorem**: The front construction algorithm terminates in $O(p^2o)$
time where $p$ is population size and $o$ is number of objectives.

**Proof**:

-   Domination check between two individuals is $O(o)$

-   All pairs check is $O(p^2o)$

-   Front construction is $O(p)$ per front

# Crossover (Simulated Binary Crossover - SBX)

Given parents $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$, create offspring $z$:

For each gene $j$: With probability $p_c$: $$
\begin{aligned}
u &\sim \text{Uniform}(0,1) \\
\beta &= \begin{cases}
(2u)^{1/(\eta+1)} & \text{if } u \leq 0.5 \\
\left(\frac{1}{2(1-u)}\right)^{1/(\eta+1)} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \\
z_j &= 0.5[(x_j + y_j) - \beta|y_j - x_j|]
\end{aligned}
$$ Else: $$
z_j = x_j
$$

**Properties**:

1.  Preserves mean: $\mathbb{E}[z_j] = \frac{x_j + y_j}{2}$

2.  Variance controlled by $\eta$ (distribution index)

3.  For $\eta \to 0$: approaches uniform crossover

4.  For $\eta \to \infty$: approaches no crossover ($z = x$ or $y$)

# Mutation

Adaptive mutation with network constraints:

For each gene $j$: With probability $p_m(t) = p_0(1 + 0.5t/T)$: $$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta_j &\sim N(0, \sigma^2) \\
\text{If network provided:} & \quad z_j \leftarrow z_j + \Delta_j(1 - \sum_k N_{jk}z_k) \\
\text{Else:} & \quad z_j \leftarrow z_j + \Delta_j
\end{aligned}
$$

**Properties**:

1.  Mutation rate increases with generation $t$

2.  Network term reduces mutation magnitude for highly connected genes

3.  Expected change: $\mathbb{E}[\Delta z_j] = 0$

4.  Variance:
    $\text{Var}(\Delta z_j) = \sigma^2(1 - \sum_k N_{jk}z_k)^2$ if
    network provided

# Replacement

Elitism + diversity-preserving replacement:

1.  Keep best individual: $x^* = \text{argmin } f_1(x)$
2.  For remaining replacements:
    -   Select random individual $x$
    -   Select offspring $y$
    -   Replace $x$ with $y$ if $\text{diversity}(x,y) > \epsilon$

Where $\text{diversity}(x,y) = \|x - y\|_2^2$

**Theorem**: This strategy preserves elitism while maintaining
population diversity.

**Proof**:

1.  Best solution is never lost

2.  Expected diversity is non-decreasing since replacements only occur
    when diversity increases

# Convergence Analysis

The algorithm can be shown to converge under certain conditions:

**Assumptions**:

1.  Finite search space

2.  Strictly positive mutation probability 3. Elitism is maintained

**Theorem**: The algorithm converges in probability to the Pareto front.

**Proof Sketch**:

1.  The selection and replacement strategies preserve Pareto optimal
    solutions (elitism)

2.  Mutation provides ergodicity (any state reachable)

3.  By the multi-objective GA convergence theorems (Rudolph 1998), the
    algorithm converges to the Pareto front

# Computational Complexity

Let: - $p$ = population size - $n$ = number of genes - $m$ = number of
samples - $o$ = number of objectives - $T$ = number of generations

**Component Complexities**:

1.  Initialization: $O(pn)$

2.  Fitness Evaluation: $O(Tpmn)$ (parallelized)

3.  Selection: $O(Tp^2o)$ worst case

4.  Crossover: $O(Tpn)$

5.  Mutation: $O(Tpn)$

6.  Replacement: $O(Tpn)$

**Total Complexity**: $O(Tp(po + mn))$

# Mathematical Optimization Interpretation

The algorithm can be viewed as a stochastic optimization method for:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize } & (f_1(P), f_2(P)) \\
\text{subject to } & P \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}
\end{aligned}
$$

Where: - $f_1$ measures data fidelity - $f_2$ measures sparsity

The GA approach is particularly suitable because:

1.  The problem is multi-objective

2.  The search space is high-dimensional

3.  The fitness landscape may be non-convex

4.  Sparsity objective is non-differentiable

# Special Cases and Relationships

1.  **Single Objective Case** ($w_2 = 0$):
    -   Reduces to nonlinear least squares optimization
    -   GA serves as global optimizer avoiding local minima
2.  **No Network Constraints**:
    -   Mutation becomes standard Gaussian mutation
    -   Problem decomposes by genes
3.  **High Crossover Rate**:
    -   Approaches a recombination-based search
    -   Faster convergence but reduced diversity

# Biological Interpretation

The mathematical operations correspond to biological concepts:

1.  **Population Initialization**: Sampling from observed biological
    variability
2.  **Fitness**: Measuring both functional efficacy (expression
    matching) and parsimony (sparsity)
3.  **Network Constraints**: Incorporating known gene-gene interactions
4.  **Clustering**: Respecting co-expressed gene modules

# Conclusion

This mathematical foundation shows that the BioGA package implements a
theoretically sound multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for genomic
data optimization, with proper attention to both computational
efficiency and biological relevance.
